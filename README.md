# Data-Intensive-Computing-Lab-3

Completed by Arlo Eardley 1108472, Carel Ross 1106684 and Ryan Verpoort 1136745

The report for this lab is available in the Documentation branch.

In order to run the code clone the repo which can be found at:

[Data-Intensive-Computng-Lab3](https://github.com/SirArlo/Data-Intensive-Computing-Lab-3)

Before the code can be run the input matricies need to be converted from sparse to a dynamic matrix, to do this the input files must be run with the Sparse-Dense script. To do this go into [Code/Matricies](Code/Matricies/Sparse-Dense.py) and run the following command in terminal for each of the files:

`python Sparse-Dense.py "FileName".list`

**To run the code enter the corresponding command in terminal in the main folder:**

For the iterative approach with a matrixA of 100x100 multiplied by matrixB of 100x100:

`python Code/AlgorithmA.py ./Code/Matricies/outA1.list ./Code/Matricies/outB1.list Output --mrs-timing-file=./Time_Results/AlgoA_small.txt`

For the iterative approach with a matrixA of 1000x500 multiplied by matrixB of 500x1000:

`python Code/AlgorithmA.py ./Code/Matricies/outA2.list ./Code/Matricies/outB2.list Output --mrs-timing-file=./Time_Results/AlgoA_medium.txt`

For the iterative approach with a matrixA of 1000x500 multiplied by matrixB of 500x1:

`python Code/AlgorithmA.py ./Code/Matricies/outA3.list ./Code/Matricies/outB3.list Output --mrs-timing-file=./Time_Results/AlgoA_large.txt`

For the Divide and Conquer approach with a matrixA of 100x100 multiplied by matrixB of 100x100:

`python Code/AlgorithmB.py ./Code/Matricies/outA1.list ./Code/Matricies/outB1.list Output --mrs-timing-file=./Time_Results/AlgoB_small.txt`

For the Divide and Conquer approach with a matrixA of 1000x500 multiplied by matrixB of 500x1000:

`python Code/AlgorithmB.py ./Code/Matricies/outA2.list ./Code/Matricies/outB2.list Output --mrs-timing-file=./Time_Results/AlgoB_medium.txt`

For the Divide and Conquer approach with a matrixA of 1000x500 multiplied by matrixB of 500x1:

`python Code/AlgorithmB.py ./Code/Matricies/outA3.list ./Code/Matricies/outB3.list Output --mrs-timing-file=./Time_Results/AlgoB_large.txt`

The time taken to complete each set of multilication can be found in the [Time_Results](Time_Results/) folder

Where the output of the results can be found in the output folder as a .mtxt file
